MP3 Cleaner
Final Project Stage 3 Code

Overview: The code is in folder “mp3player”. The music is in folder “music”. There should also be this README file and two screenshots. The folder music contains 3 artists, 3 albums, and 30 songs. Compile and run mp3player in Eclipse. Choose the music in this folder when running the program.

How-to: Use the help button in the program. Upper left hand corner click File -> Help. Click Add to begin using the program. Next select music in the table while holding “command” key on Mac or “control” key on Windows. Click Load and type a new genre or fix the spelling in the album or artist name into the text fields. When your ready click Auto to change the text. A prompt will appear asking you if you want to save click “Save” if you want to keep the changes. Otherwise click “Stop” and nothing will happen. While you have music in the table you can click the “Remove” button to clear the music library table and start over.

Environment: My environment was a Macbook OS X El Capitan 10.11.3 Eclipse Luna Java 1.8+.  

Testing: Please use the music in the folder for testing purposes. This is the same music I have been testing with.  The music is in folder “music” in the same directory this README file is located.  
 
Conclusion: This program works for almost 1,000 mp3 files currently in my music library. However this program only works for mp3 files so if you have a mixture of .mp3 and .mp4 or .m4a files the program will only add mp3 files which is why I included a sample music library.
